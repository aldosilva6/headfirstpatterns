# Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary
independently from clients that use it.

Favor composition over inheritance.

With inheritance, you make code duplications, add behavior to classes that doesn't need, more difficult to maintain.

Change behavior at runtime
