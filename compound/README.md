# Adapter Pattern
A goose came along and wanted to act like a Quackable too.So we used the Adapter Pattern to adapt the goose to a Quackable.

# Decorator Pattern
The Quackologists decided they wanted to count quacks. So we used the Decorator Pattern to add a QuackCounter decorator that
keeps track of the number of times quack() is called, and then delegates the quack to the Quackable it's wrapping

# Abstract Factory
The Quackologists were worried to forget to add the QuackCounter decorator. So we used the Abstrac Factory Pattern to create
ducks for them

# Composite Pattern
We had management problems keeping track of all those ducks and geese and Quackable. So we used Composite Pattern to group 
Quackables into Flocks. Also allows the Quackologists to create subFolks to manage duck families.

# Observer Pattern
The Quackologists also wanted to be notified when any Quackable quacked. So we used Observer Pattern to let Quackologists register
as Quackable Observers. Now they're notified every time any Quackable quacks.
